# ChatSQL Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)

This is a lightweight scaffold based on the design doc. To run:

1. cd chatsql-frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8000` by default.

Notes:
- Monaco editor requires installing `@monaco-editor/react` (already in package.json).
- Tailwind is included in devDependencies; to enable it fully, run the tailwind init steps from the design doc.
